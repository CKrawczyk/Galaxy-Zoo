      <p class="description">
        Roughly one hundred billion galaxies are scattered throughout our observable Universe, each a glorious system that might contain billions of stars. Many are remarkably beautiful, and the aim of Galaxy Zoo is to study them, assisting astronomers in attempting to understand how the galaxies we see around us formed, and what their stories can tell us about the past, present and future of our Universe as a whole. <a data-nav="#/science" href="#/science">more</a>

      <p class="description">
        The launch of this new version of Galaxy Zoo, the 4th, comes just a few weeks after the siteâ€™s 5th birthday. It all started back in July 2007, with a data set made up of a million galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, who still provide some of the images in the site today. With so many galaxies, we'd assumed it would take years for visitors to the site to work through them all, but within 24 hours of launch we were stunned to be receiving almost 70,000 classifications an hour. In the end, more than 50 million classifications were received by the project during its first year, contributed by more than 150,000 people. <a data-nav="#/story" href="#/story">more</a>

      <p class="description">Are you an educator? Would you like to use Galaxy Zoo with a group of students? The <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/navigator/home">Navigator</a> is an interactive tool that allows groups to classify galaxies together and then investigate galaxy characteristics. <a href="http://www.zooteach.org/zoo/galaxy_zoo">Zoo Teach</a> is where educators can share lessons, resources and that compliment the citizen science projects that are part of the Zooniverse.</p>
